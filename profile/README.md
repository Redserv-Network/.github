## Hi there 👋

We're small indie French Canadian🇨🇦 devs making a small idiotic Minecraft server network for our friends. Currently, there are no public repos as we're using this org for grouping them privately 😉

In the meantime, feel free to join the MC server at `redserv.net` 🖱️ Also, you can [join our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/R4qwvAfrVS)!

Thanks!

(those .md files are so annoying to make!!)
